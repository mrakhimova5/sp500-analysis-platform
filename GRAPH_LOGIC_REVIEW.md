## âœ… CALCULATION VERIFICATION - ALL 12 VISUALIZATIONS

### 1. **Strategic Trends Line Chart** (`strategic_trends.png`)
**Purpose**: Show raw mention counts over time for each category

**Calculation**:
```python
plt.plot(df.columns, df.loc[category], marker='o')
```

**Logic**: 
- X-axis: Years (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)
- Y-axis: Raw count of keyword mentions
- Each line = one category

**Verification**: âœ… **CORRECT**
- Uses raw data directly from keyword counting
- No transformations applied
- Shows absolute volume trends

---

### 2. **Within-Year Category Distribution Heatmap** (`strategic_heatmap.png`)
**Purpose**: Show what % each category represents within each year

**Calculation**:
```python
normalized_df = df.div(df.sum(axis=0), axis=1)
```

**Logic**:
- For each year (column), divide each category value by the sum of all categories
- Formula: `category_count / total_all_categories_that_year * 100`
- Example: If AI=50, Cloud=30, Security=20 in 2020:
  - AI = 50/100 = 50%
  - Cloud = 30/100 = 30%
  - Security = 20/100 = 20%

**Verification**: âœ… **CORRECT**
- Each column sums to 1.0 (100%)
- Shows relative composition within each year
- Answers: "What share of total mentions did AI represent in 2023?"

---

### 3. **Relative Importance Heatmap** (`normalized_heatmap.png`)
**Purpose**: Show which category-year combinations represent the most mentions overall

**Calculation**:
```python
total_all = df.values.sum()  # Sum of ALL mentions across ALL categories and years
normalized_df = (df / total_all) * 100
```

**Logic**:
- Calculate total mentions across entire dataset (all categories, all years)
- For each cell: `(category_year_count / grand_total) * 100`
- Example: If total across all = 1000 mentions
  - AI 2020 = 50 mentions â†’ 50/1000 = 5.0%
  - AI 2024 = 100 mentions â†’ 100/1000 = 10.0%
  - Cloud 2020 = 30 mentions â†’ 30/1000 = 3.0%

**Verification**: âœ… **CORRECT**
- All cells sum to 100% (entire dataset)
- Shows absolute importance in context of everything
- Darkest cells = most significant category-year combinations
- Answers: "Which category-year had the most impact overall?"

**Key Difference from Heatmap #2**:
- Heatmap #2 (Within-Year): Each COLUMN sums to 100%
- Heatmap #3 (Relative Importance): ALL CELLS sum to 100%
- This shows cross-time importance, not just within-year distribution

---

### 4. **Stacked Area Chart** (`stacked_area_chart.png`)
**Purpose**: Show composition of total mentions over time

**Calculation**:
```python
plt.stackplot(df_transposed.index, 
              [df_transposed[col] for col in df_transposed.columns])
```

**Logic**:
- X-axis: Years
- Y-axis: Stacked raw counts (each layer = one category)
- Total height = sum of all categories
- Each colored area shows one category's contribution

**Verification**: âœ… **CORRECT**
- Uses raw counts (no transformation)
- Areas stack additively
- Top of stack = total mentions across all categories
- Answers: "How is the total volume distributed and growing?"

---

### 5. **Category Share Evolution** (`category_share_evolution.png`)
**Purpose**: Show how each category's % share changes over time

**Calculation**:
```python
pct_df = df.div(df.sum(axis=0), axis=1) * 100
```

**Logic**:
- Same calculation as heatmap #2, but visualized as line chart
- For each year, calculate: `category_count / total_all_categories * 100`
- Each line shows one category's % share trajectory

**Verification**: âœ… **CORRECT**
- Same logic as within-year heatmap (validated above)
- All lines at any given year sum to 100%
- Better for tracking trends than heatmap
- Answers: "Is AI's share increasing or decreasing over time?"

---

### 6. **Strategic Growth Chart** (`strategic_growth_YYYY_to_YYYY.png`)
**Purpose**: Show total % change from first year to last year

**Calculation**:
```python
if start_val == 0 and end_val == 0:
    growth_pct = 0
elif start_val == 0:
    growth_pct = 100  # New category
else:
    growth_pct = ((end_val - start_val) / start_val * 100)
```

**Logic**:
- Formula: `(2024_value - 2020_value) / 2020_value * 100`
- Special cases:
  - Both zero: 0% growth
  - Started at zero: 100% (new category)
  - Standard: percentage change formula

**Verification**: âœ… **CORRECT**
- Standard percentage change formula
- Handles edge cases (division by zero)
- Shows cumulative 5-year growth
- Answers: "Which categories grew the most from 2020 to 2024?"

---

### 7-11. **Top Terms Charts** (`top_terms_YYYY.png` for each year)
**Purpose**: Show which specific keywords were mentioned most in each year

**Calculation**:
```python
all_terms = []
for category, data in yearly_keyword_counts[year].items():
    for term, count in data['terms'].items():
        all_terms.append({'term': term, 'count': count, 'category': category})

top_terms = sorted(all_terms, key=lambda x: x['count'], reverse=True)[:top_n]
```

**Logic**:
- Collect all individual keyword counts for the year
- Sort by count (descending)
- Take top 15
- Display as horizontal bar chart

**Verification**: âœ… **CORRECT**
- Simple sorting and ranking
- No transformations
- Shows actual mention counts
- Answers: "What specific terms dominated in 2022?"

---

### 12. **Year-over-Year Change Chart** (`yoy_change_chart.png`)
**Purpose**: Show momentum - how much each category changed vs previous year

**Calculation**:
```python
for i in range(1, len(years)):
    prev_year = years[i-1]
    curr_year = years[i]
    
    yoy_changes[f'{prev_year}â†’{curr_year}'] = df.apply(
        lambda row: ((row[curr_year] - row[prev_year]) / row[prev_year] * 100) 
        if row[prev_year] > 0 else (100 if row[curr_year] > 0 else 0),
        axis=1
    )
```

**Logic**:
- Calculate 4 transitions: 2020â†’2021, 2021â†’2022, 2022â†’2023, 2023â†’2024
- For each: `(curr_year - prev_year) / prev_year * 100`
- Grouped bars show all 4 transitions for each category
- Special case: if previous year = 0, set to 100% if current > 0

**Verification**: âœ… **CORRECT**
- Standard YoY percentage change formula
- Handles division by zero
- Shows acceleration/deceleration patterns
- Answers: "When did AI mentions accelerate? When did they plateau?"

**Percentage-Based Within Year** (normalized to 100% per year):
2. âœ… Within-Year Heatmap - % of total mentions in each year
5. âœ… Share Evolution - Same calculation, line chart format

**Growth Calculations** (vs baseline or previous period):
3. âœ… Normalized Heatmap - Index vs 2020 baseline (2020=100)
6. âœ… Growth Chart - Total % change 2020â†’2024
12. âœ… YoY Change - % change from previous year

### Key Insights Each Graph Provides

| Graph | Question Answered |
|-------|------------------|
| Trends | What is the absolute volume trajectory? |
| Within-Year Heatmap | What % of focus went to each category in year X? |
| Normalized Heatmap | How much has category X grown since 2020? |
| Stacked Area | How is total volume distributed and changing? |

### No Logic Errors Detected

All formulas use standard statistical/business calculations:
- âœ… Percentage of total
